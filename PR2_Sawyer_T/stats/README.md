==============

A collection of handy, useful, and intriguing Python scripts focused on retrieving, analyzing, and interpreting Data and Data Sets into powerful graphics and representations. This repository was built for the UVM Spring 2014 course, 'Introduction to Data Science and Visualization' with the sole purpose of demonstrating my final project contents. I provide functions for all to use in their studies, and I encourage my contributors to do the same.
