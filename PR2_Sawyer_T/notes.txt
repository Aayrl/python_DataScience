[4/22/14::9:51] Initial File Creation. Built all required files and file structures.
	Documented the readme.txt file and started the notes.txt file.
	Built 'skeleton' report.ipynb file with basic formatting.
	Inserted the 'Goals / Questions' sections into my report for easy reference.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[4/22/14::10:05] Added final project Background summary to my final report file.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[4/22/14::11:25] Built initial file structure for final report.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[4/23/14::14:56] Began to format final project file and initial GitHub setup for scripting backups.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[4/28/14::17:35] Definitely glad I backed up data .. VirtualMachine running Canopy has failed to launch.
		After several hours of attempting to recover the virtual machine, I have decided to build
		a new Virtual Machine on a different computer to hopefully handle Canopy and its memory 
		requirements better.

		Final Project files had been backed up, so I just need to set up another Linux Virtual Machine
		and re-install Canopy.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[4/30/14::18:42] Built a new VirtualMachine environment for running Canopy. Restarting progress on Final
		Project.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::12:36] Starting to obtain data sets and ensure data files are properly formatted.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::12:36] I now have the majority of the data sets. Most of them have some interesting formatting (namely, some 
		titles and and additional footnotes acknowledging their aquisition. Going to see if I can write a simple 
		python script to start pulling the data out of these spreadsheets.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::13:35] Spent the past hour formatting my report and filling in some of the necessary information, such as 
		the data set links, the licenses for all of these datasets, and some of the formal questions I will 
		be investigating throughout my report. Now I shall begin writing python scripts to pull data out of these
		spreadsheets.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::14:38] Built a GitHub repo for my project for back-up storage and revision control. Going to work on 
		extracting data from spreadsheets now.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::15:03] Experiencing issues grabbing data from .xls files. Attempting to convert these files to CSV files and
		then I will see if I can obtain the data from the CSV files instead.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::15:30] Got the State Population spreadsheet in CSV format, but some of the rows were throwing weird errors.
		Going to try a different strategy to convert to CSV.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::15:35] State Population CSV works great. Writing a function to parse CSV into a dictionary.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::15:51] Writing a function for parsing that particular CSV seemed unecessary. I have a script that can 
		successfully parse this information. Time to start building some graphs.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::16:14] Brainstormed ideas for graphs to demonstrate my data sets. I think I'll builda heat map of the US 
		continent based on US Population and US Population density for each of the year brackets. If I have 
		time, I may use the JSAnimation library to animate these if I can figure that out.

		Then I'll play around with histograms and see if we can get side by side comparisons of states and 
		their population / population densities.

		Then i'll try to get some Wunderground weather data for each of these year brackets, do a similar heat 
		map for Precipitation and average temperature and then attempt to see any relation between the
		two maps.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::16:33] Got the US Map showing up just wonderfully. Now to see if I can populate it with HeatMap Data.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::17:49] After a lot of work, I got the heatmap working. I am now tweaking it to work with my data and
		perhaps I will make a heatmap generator function for future heatmaps. We'll see how this works with time.
		My goal is to have a couple of these maps by the end of the day and maybe even have a simple JSAnimation
		for a sequence of these maps.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::18:29] GOT THE HEAT MAP TO WORK! Now to play with the display options and make it look fancy.
		Next, I'll try to get some animations rolling, or perhaps build a function for generating
		heatmaps. 

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::18:46] Done styling HeatMap. Taking a break for food, then possibly build a function for generating HeatMaps.
		Then, I will play with JSAnimation library to see if I can animate some HeatMaps.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::20:25] Managed to construct a buildHeatMap function. Going to push to GitHub and then incorporate this into
		my final data report (ipynb) file. Next step is to try and animate this.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::23:01] Got the graphs showing up in the report - now I am going to try and animate this.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::23:25] Just spent the last half hour trying to get JSAnimation to work, and it turns out there is an error 
		with the library that the developer is aware of, and it doesn't seem to work in my notebook files.
		I am going to skip the animation step, though it would've been powerful to show off the data trends.
		Instead, I am going to try and see if I can do some predictive model analysis, but I will leave that for 
		tomorrow after I get some sleep. 

		I managed to get the heatmaps working for the first set of data today, so I am in at a good starting point.
		From here, I will try to build some histograms or line graphs of this data and then see if I can start 
		showing two datasets on the same graph, and possibly get some weather or gas price data in here at some
		point for some different types of graphs.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::9:45] I am back. Going to try and get JSAnimation to work again. Otherwise, I'll go back to the circle approach
		from my midterm project and simply overlay different color and size circles for different data sets 
		over the map of the US and use that kind of a formatting to show comparisons between data sets.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::10:33] Got the JSAnimation library to work properly. Now going to try and see if I can overlay the heatmaps on top
		of this animation platform.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::10:57] After looking at some examples, I have a working JSAnimation of a point moving around a world map.
		Fascinating. Let's see if I can integrate my heatmaps into this type of a format and then we will be
		rocking and rolling with some snazzy looking animations of my data sets over a period of time
		Woohoo!

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::12:24] Been wrangling with the heatmap animation for about two hours now. Having difficulties getting the map 
		to update with the animation, though I can load the individual frames just fine. Not sure where to go 
		from here, no documentation available on the web for this type of problem, and there are no examples 
		of something similar. Looks like I'll have to just play around with it for the next hour or so and see
		if I can get it to work. If I have nothing by 13:30, I'll go with the circle size solution and then 
		continue progress on this project.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::14:22] Spent the past two hours trying to get the HeatMap animation to work to no avail. I'm going to fall
		back to the Circle representation I used on the VT Map from my Midterm Project and animate those
		over time instead - will be so much easier to implement.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::16:00] Still in the process of mapping the circle-animation map.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::16:55] Close to getting the circle animation to work. Trying to figure out how to get the marker sizes to
		increase rather than move about. Not going so well, Canopy keeps crashing. I am impressed by how 
		aweful this software is at handling runtime errors. Rather frustrating that I have to reboot the 
		system running Canopy every 30 minutes in order for it to run animations smoothly.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::17:25] GOT IT TO WORK! Now I am trying to add some date animation to the whole thing so we can fully see
		the evolution of aspects over time.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::17:41] Got some Date Annotations on the animation now. It's very pretty, and I am glad I got -something- to work.
		A heatmap would've been much better, but this will work sufficiently. 

		I am now working on importing my next data set and the first cross-dataset analysis.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::18:06] Got the next set of data imported properly (unemployment percentages). I am going to break for food 
		and then hopefully do some heatmaps with the unemployment rates and then do an animation for that.
		Then, I'll overlay that animation with the population animation to see if the population is 
		correlated with the unemployment rate.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::19:55] Back in action making heat maps for unemployment rates.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::21:04] Got unemployment heatmaps working just fine - having some weird issues with the animation for the 
		unemployment to work properly. Restarting canopy to see if I can get it to work properly.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::21:13] So...now for some reason my JSAnimation library is not correctly generating animations from the script 
		that was working not more than an hour ago. Very peculiar. I'm trying to 'fix' it. In the meantime, I
		am leaving the one JSAnimation that was working alone in the unfortunate event I cannot recover the 
		function - though I have no idea why it's suddenly not working.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::21:17] Played some Import Magic and the original animate function works again. Now to try and get unemployment
		data to animate...not sure why it's complaining. It's literally the same type of data.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::21:30] Got the unemployment animation to work. The issue? Floats are not equal to integers, and the
		animation library cried when it was given floats instead of integers. I told it to parse them as
		floats and It was all happy. Wow. Unemployment skyrocketed in 2009. Time to overlay this data with
		my population data.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::21:57] Got the unemployment animation to work with the population animation. Does not seem to be any powerful
		correlation between the two. Time to investigate cost of living vs population and see how that fairs.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::22:05] So it turns out the cost of living spreadsheet from the US Census Bureau was corrupt, but thankfully
		I have the average housing costs for each year between 1991 and 2010. This shows the average cost of 
		purchasing and maintaining a house in each state in the US, so this should be a fairly accurate 
		substitute. We shall soon see.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::22:30] Got the housing cost heat maps working okay. Can really see the big housing drop between 2007 
		and 2008. Currently waiting for the animation function to fully process. Should hopefully work okay.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::22:47] Animation function worked great. Comparing Population to Housing Costs now, and then will compare 
		unemployment to housing costs. Both animations. Should be wonderful.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::23:11] Got the animations for Housing Costs + Population and Housing Costs + Unemployment working.
		Heading home for the day. Will return early tomorrow to finish the project (hopefully). Got
		3 or 4 data sets to pound through, but all of the grunt work (building functions) is done. 
		I simply need to scrub the data and make it pretty in the animations and then analyze the trends 
		I see. Should hopefully take me maybe 10 more hours of work.

		Great progress today! Excited the animations are working!

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/3/14::17:28] Back to work .. wish I could've started earlier this morning but I guess I'll work late tonight.
		Working on annual wage data and then I'll spend some time looking for trends between this and 
		other data sets. Then, I'll look into the purchasing power of the dollar and check out its correlation
		with my data sets.

		Lastly, time permitting, I'll grab some weather and gas price data (Hopefully, though I know I can 
		get the weather data) and see if I can form any correlations between weather and the previous
		data sets.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/3/14::17:54] Got the heatmaps for the annual wages working. Going to work on the animation portion now.
