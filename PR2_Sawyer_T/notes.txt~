[4/22/14::9:51] Initial File Creation. Built all required files and file structures.
	Documented the readme.txt file and started the notes.txt file.
	Built 'skeleton' report.ipynb file with basic formatting.
	Inserted the 'Goals / Questions' sections into my report for easy reference.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[4/22/14::10:05] Added final project Background summary to my final report file.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[4/22/14::11:25] Built initial file structure for final report.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[4/23/14::14:56] Began to format final project file and initial GitHub setup for scripting backups.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[4/28/14::17:35] Definitely glad I backed up data .. VirtualMachine running Canopy has failed to launch.
		After several hours of attempting to recover the virtual machine, I have decided to build
		a new Virtual Machine on a different computer to hopefully handle Canopy and its memory 
		requirements better.

		Final Project files had been backed up, so I just need to set up another Linux Virtual Machine
		and re-install Canopy.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[4/30/14::18:42] Built a new VirtualMachine environment for running Canopy. Restarting progress on Final
		Project.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::12:36] Starting to obtain data sets and ensure data files are properly formatted.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::12:36] I now have the majority of the data sets. Most of them have some interesting formatting (namely, some 
		titles and and additional footnotes acknowledging their aquisition. Going to see if I can write a simple 
		python script to start pulling the data out of these spreadsheets.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::13:35] Spent the past hour formatting my report and filling in some of the necessary information, such as 
		the data set links, the licenses for all of these datasets, and some of the formal questions I will 
		be investigating throughout my report. Now I shall begin writing python scripts to pull data out of these
		spreadsheets.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::14:38] Built a GitHub repo for my project for back-up storage and revision control. Going to work on 
		extracting data from spreadsheets now.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::15:03] Experiencing issues grabbing data from .xls files. Attempting to convert these files to CSV files and
		then I will see if I can obtain the data from the CSV files instead.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::15:30] Got the State Population spreadsheet in CSV format, but some of the rows were throwing weird errors.
		Going to try a different strategy to convert to CSV.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::15:35] State Population CSV works great. Writing a function to parse CSV into a dictionary.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::15:51] Writing a function for parsing that particular CSV seemed unecessary. I have a script that can 
		successfully parse this information. Time to start building some graphs.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::16:14] Brainstormed ideas for graphs to demonstrate my data sets. I think I'll builda heat map of the US 
		continent based on US Population and US Population density for each of the year brackets. If I have 
		time, I may use the JSAnimation library to animate these if I can figure that out.

		Then I'll play around with histograms and see if we can get side by side comparisons of states and 
		their population / population densities.

		Then i'll try to get some Wunderground weather data for each of these year brackets, do a similar heat 
		map for Precipitation and average temperature and then attempt to see any relation between the
		two maps.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::16:33] Got the US Map showing up just wonderfully. Now to see if I can populate it with HeatMap Data.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::17:49] After a lot of work, I got the heatmap working. I am now tweaking it to work with my data and
		perhaps I will make a heatmap generator function for future heatmaps. We'll see how this works with time.
		My goal is to have a couple of these maps by the end of the day and maybe even have a simple JSAnimation
		for a sequence of these maps.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::18:29] GOT THE HEAT MAP TO WORK! Now to play with the display options and make it look fancy.
		Next, I'll try to get some animations rolling, or perhaps build a function for generating
		heatmaps. 

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::18:46] Done styling HeatMap. Taking a break for food, then possibly build a function for generating HeatMaps.
		Then, I will play with JSAnimation library to see if I can animate some HeatMaps.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::20:25] Managed to construct a buildHeatMap function. Going to push to GitHub and then incorporate this into
		my final data report (ipynb) file. Next step is to try and animate this.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::23:01] Got the graphs showing up in the report - now I am going to try and animate this.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/1/14::23:25] Just spent the last half hour trying to get JSAnimation to work, and it turns out there is an error 
		with the library that the developer is aware of, and it doesn't seem to work in my notebook files.
		I am going to skip the animation step, though it would've been powerful to show off the data trends.
		Instead, I am going to try and see if I can do some predictive model analysis, but I will leave that for 
		tomorrow after I get some sleep. 

		I managed to get the heatmaps working for the first set of data today, so I am in at a good starting point.
		From here, I will try to build some histograms or line graphs of this data and then see if I can start 
		showing two datasets on the same graph, and possibly get some weather or gas price data in here at some
		point for some different types of graphs.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::9:45] I am back. Going to try and get JSAnimation to work again. Otherwise, I'll go back to the circle approach
		from my midterm project and simply overlay different color and size circles for different data sets 
		over the map of the US and use that kind of a formatting to show comparisons between data sets.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5/2/14::10:33] Got the JSAnimation library to work properly. Now going to try and see if I can overlay the heatmaps on top
		of this animation platform.
