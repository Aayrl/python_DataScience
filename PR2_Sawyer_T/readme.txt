1) Viewing the Report
	
	To view the report, you will need to open or render the file labeled
	'report_Sawyer_T.ipynb' in either:
		1) an iPython Renderer (Try: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/)
		2) A web browser capable of rendering XML pages.
		3) An XHTML or Python editor

	The report contains all the necessary information for learning about
	my final project, including:
		1) Project Questions / Goals
		2) Project Abstract
		3) Project Datasets & Analysis
		4) Conclusions / Answers to Questions

2) Project Contents

	./data/~				: This folder contains RAW data and dataset files.

	./stats/~				: This folder contains either snippets of code (for testing), or 
				    		  extraneous log files that are generated as a result of code processes.

	./readme.txt 				: This file : General information about all files. 

	./notes.txt 				: This file contains a running list of ideas, trials, and results of any code or 
						    code processing that occurs during my research. Each entry is separated by a horizonal
						    line, and each entry is timestamped with each modification being timestamped as well. 
						    This will provide you (the reader) with a general idea of how long each task took me to 
						    process and what results I yielded from each of my experiments.

	./report_Sawyer_T.ipynb			: This is the main Report file. See Part (1) of this Readme for more details.
